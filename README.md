# JavaScript Data Structure

This repository aims implements some data structures in JavaScript.

## Stacks

Stacks are an example of a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. An array or linked list can be used to implement a stack in JavaScript. Stacks are commonly used for managing function calls, tracking state changes, and parsing expressions.

## Queues

Queues are another linear data structure, but they follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Queues are used for tasks like managing tasks in a job queue or handling requests in a web server. You can implement a queue in JavaScript using an array or a linked list.

## Circular Queues

A circular queue is the extended version of a regular queue where the last element is connected to the first element. Thus forming a circle-like structure.

## Linked Lists

Linked lists are fundamental data structures that consist of nodes, each containing a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are useful for implementing data structures like stacks and queues. In JavaScript, you can create a simple linked list using objects. Linked lists are particularly helpful when dealing with data that needs frequent insertions or deletions.

## Linked Lists With Tail

Linked list with tail is the same as regular linked list, but with the possibility of tracking the value at the end of the list. This can improve performance in some linked lists methods.
